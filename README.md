# LearningHaskell
Personal solutions for programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton (2016)
Since this is a learning project; it does not represent best practices. 

## Rules
To learn as much as I can, I have imposed the following rules on this project: 
- I should always consult [hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/), or the [Haskell Documentation](https://www.haskell.org/documentation/) when stuck
- I cannot use ChatGPT. PERIOD.
- I will only used GHCI

## Find a bug? 
If you find a bug, you are welcome to open an issue \
Before you open an issue, please note I have written the solutions in accordance with the requirements in Hutton's book, not necessarily best practices.

## Credit:
I would like to thank Dr Graham Hutton for making his course available on youtube
