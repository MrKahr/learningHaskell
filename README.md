# LearningHaskell
Personal solutions for programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton (2016)
Since this is a learning project; it does not represent best practices. 

## Rules
To learn as much as I can, I have imposed the following rules on this project: 
- I should always consult [hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/), or the [Haskell Documentation](https://www.haskell.org/documentation/) when stuck
- ChatGPT is not allowed to write any of my source code, but can provide bugfixing tips, and be used to search/suggest sources.
- I should mostly use ghci to become familiar with it. 

## Find a bug? 
If you find a bug, you are welcome to open an issue \
Before you open an issue, please note I have written the solutions in accordance with the requirements in Hutton's book, not necessarily best practices.
